# ‚≠êÔ∏è NYU-ViscoMOD
Temporal-Modulus Analyzer v1.1.4  
This is an application that interactively loads frequency, temperature, and storage modulus data, performs time‚Äìtemperature superposition analysis and master curve fitting, and visualizes and exports the viscoelastic properties of materials.
# üöÄ Getting Start 
I. Running the following command in the terminal will generate the executable file `NYU-ViscoMOD-v1.1.4.exe` in the `dist` directory:
```bash  
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed NYU-ViscoMOD-v1.1.4.py
```
II. Method for generating installable file:  
1. Install `Inno Setup 6`.
2. After generating the executable file `NYU-ViscoMOD-v1.1.4.exe` in Step 1, proceed to run the installer script `NYU-ViscoMOD-v1.1.4.iss`.
3. Note: The file paths specified in `NYU-ViscoMOD-v1.1.4.iss` are based on the developer's local environment. Before running the script, please update the paths to `license.txt` and `nyu_5u6_icon.ico` to match your system.
